# snake_game

A Classic game we all remember playing in Nokia 3310  : )

Instructions to play :

1.1 : Download the Snake_Game.exe file and open it.

1.2 : A blank command prompt will open for a brief seconds. Do not panic.

2.1 : Our brother Snake will start moving. Control it with the Arrow Keys ( ↑ → ↓ ← ) from your keyboard.

2.2 : If it hits the wall, Game Over.

2.3 : If it bites itself, Game Over.

2.4 : The length of our Snake increases as you eat the food.

2.5 : Score represents the number of food you have eaten.


Note : This is my first attempt at creating a game using Turtle modules in Python. You may find minor bugs here and there.
